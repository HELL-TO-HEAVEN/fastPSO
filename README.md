# pyPSO
Fast parallel Particle Swarm Optimization package for Python

__pyPSO__ is an open source software library for Particle Swarm Optimization built with two goals in mind:
  * Speed
  * Parallelism
  
Its flexible architecture enables you to define complex objective functions, and to perform optimization in a __serial__ or __parallel__ setting. In addition, it offers detailed insights on the optimization process, helping practitioners profile their results.
